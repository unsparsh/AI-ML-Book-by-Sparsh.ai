## Content

### 1. What are LSTMs?
- **Concept**: LSTMs are a type of RNN that overcome the limitations of standard RNNs by using a gating mechanism to manage memory.
- **Advantages**: LSTMs can handle longer sequences and remember important information over extended timesteps.

### 2. How LSTMs Work
- **Structure**: LSTMs use a combination of gates (input, forget, and output gates) to control the flow of information.
- **Applications**: Often used for tasks that require learning long-term dependencies, like language translation or video analysis.

### 3. Applications of LSTMs
- **Examples**: Language translation, video captioning, and long-term time-series analysis.

### Exercise
1. **Build an LSTM Network**: Train an LSTM on a sequence dataset and compare its performance with a standard RNN.
2. **Experiment**: Test the effect of different sequence lengths and observe the model's accuracy.
