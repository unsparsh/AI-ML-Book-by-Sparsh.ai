## Content

### 1. What are Convolutional Neural Networks?
- **Concept**: CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for handling spatial data, like images.
- **How It Works**: Uses filters (kernels) to capture spatial hierarchies in the data.

### 2. Components of a CNN
- **Convolutional Layers**: Detect features like edges or textures by applying filters over the image.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the size of feature maps, retaining essential features while reducing computation.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Act like a traditional neural network layer, combining features to make a final prediction.

### 3. Applications of CNNs
- **Examples**: Image classification, object detection, facial recognition.

### Exercise
1. **Build a CNN**: Train a CNN to classify images from a small dataset, like CIFAR-10.
2. **Experiment**: Modify the filter size or number of filters and see how it changes model accuracy.
