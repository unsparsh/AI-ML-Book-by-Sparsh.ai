## Content

### 1. What are Recurrent Neural Networks?
- **Concept**: RNNs are neural networks that excel at processing sequences, such as time series or language data.
- **Sequential Processing**: RNNs retain information from previous steps, allowing them to maintain context across sequences.

### 2. How RNNs Work
- **Structure**: RNNs have loops within their architecture, allowing the network to pass information across timesteps.
- **Challenges**: RNNs can suffer from issues like vanishing gradients, limiting the length of sequences they can process effectively.

### 3. Applications of RNNs
- **Examples**: Language modeling, speech recognition, time-series forecasting.

### Exercise
1. **Implement a Simple RNN**: Build an RNN for a basic sequence classification task.
2. **Experiment**: Try adjusting the sequence length and see how it affects model performance.
