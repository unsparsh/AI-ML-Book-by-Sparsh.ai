### 1. What is Q-Learning?
- **Concept**: Q-Learning is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm where an agent learns to estimate the optimal action-value function (Q-function) for each state-action pair.
- **Goal**: The Q-function helps the agent determine which action to take at each state to maximize cumulative reward.

### 2. What is Deep Q-Learning?
- **Deep Q-Learning**: This approach combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle large, complex environments.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)**: These are neural networks used to approximate the Q-values for each action given a state, allowing for decision-making in high-dimensional spaces.

### 3. Applications of Deep Q-Learning
- **Examples**: Video game AI, autonomous driving in simulations, and robotic control.

### Exercise
1. **Implement a DQN Model**: Build a DQN model in a simple environment like OpenAI Gym's CartPole.
2. **Experiment**: Modify parameters like learning rate and batch size and observe how they affect performance.
