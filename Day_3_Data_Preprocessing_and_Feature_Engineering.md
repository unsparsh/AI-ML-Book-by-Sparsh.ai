### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Concept**: Data preprocessing is the process of preparing raw data to make it suitable for building machine learning models. Raw data is often noisy, inconsistent, or incomplete, and needs to be cleaned before it’s useful.

- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering out irrelevant data.
     - **Example**: If a dataset has a missing age field, we could fill it with the average age, drop the record, or use other methods.
  2. **Data Transformation**: Changing data types, normalizing or standardizing data, and encoding categorical variables.
     - **Example**: Standardizing features by scaling them to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
  3. **Data Reduction**: Reducing the data volume without losing valuable information.
     - **Example**: Reducing the number of features or rows to make data manageable while preserving essential information.

- **Common Data Cleaning Techniques**:
  - **Handling Missing Data**: Using methods like mean/mode imputation or dropping rows/columns.
  - **Removing Outliers**: Removing data points that are significantly different from others.
  - **Encoding Categorical Data**: Converting categorical variables into a numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Concept**: Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to help the model capture patterns in the data more effectively.

- **Why Feature Engineering is Important**: Good features are critical to improving model accuracy. In many cases, the right features can make a simple algorithm outperform complex algorithms with poor features.

- **Common Techniques**:
  - **Feature Creation**: Creating new features by combining or transforming existing ones.
    - **Example**: In a dataset with “Height” and “Weight” columns, we can create a new feature, “BMI” (Body Mass Index), by combining these two.
  - **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features for the model, often to reduce overfitting and improve interpretability.
    - **Example**: Using correlation analysis or feature importance scores to select key features.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while preserving as much information as possible, often with techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

### Example Scenario
Imagine we have a dataset of students' grades, attendance, and participation scores, and we want to predict final exam scores. In data preprocessing, we might fill missing attendance records, standardize scores, and handle outliers in grades. In feature engineering, we could combine attendance and participation into a “participation index” to capture overall involvement in class.

### Exercise
1. **Data Cleaning Practice**: Take a sample dataset with missing values, and apply techniques like mean imputation or removing rows with missing data.
2. **Feature Engineering Challenge**: Create a new feature by combining two existing ones in a dataset. For example, if you have a “Price” and “Quantity Sold” feature, create a new feature for “Total Revenue.”
