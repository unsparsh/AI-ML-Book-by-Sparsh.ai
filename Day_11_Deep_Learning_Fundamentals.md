## Content

### 1. What is Deep Learning?
- **Concept**: Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses large, deep neural networks to model complex patterns.
- **Difference from ML**: While traditional ML may rely on simpler algorithms and feature engineering, deep learning learns complex patterns and features directly from data.

### 2. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
- **Structure**: A DNN has many hidden layers, enabling it to learn intricate patterns.
- **How It Works**: Layers of neurons process data in successive steps, extracting higher-level patterns at each stage.

### 3. Applications of Deep Learning
- **Examples**: Image recognition, language processing, self-driving cars, and more.

### Exercise
1. **Implement a Simple DNN**: Build a DNN with two hidden layers on a small dataset, like MNIST digits.
2. **Experiment**: Try adding or removing layers and observe how it affects performance.
