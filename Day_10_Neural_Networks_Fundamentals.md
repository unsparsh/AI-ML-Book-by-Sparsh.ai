## Content

### 1. What is a Neural Network?
- **Concept**: Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of neurons organized in layers that process and learn from data.
- **Components**: Input layer, hidden layers, output layer.

### 2. Neurons and Layers
- **Neuron**: Receives inputs, applies weights, and passes through an activation function.
- **Layers**: Stacked layers help the network learn complex patterns. The depth and size of hidden layers impact model performance.

### 3. Activation Functions
- **Purpose**: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to allow networks to model complex data.
- **Examples**: Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh.

### Exercise
1. **Build a Simple Neural Network**: Create a neural network with one hidden layer to classify a small dataset.
2. **Experiment with Activation Functions**: Test how different activations affect model predictions.
