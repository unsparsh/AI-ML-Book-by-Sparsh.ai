### 1. What is Reinforcement Learning?
- **Concept**: Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
- **Goal**: The agent aims to maximize its cumulative reward over time.

### 2. Key Components in RL
- **Agent**: The decision-maker that learns to perform actions.
- **Environment**: The setting where the agent operates.
- **Reward**: Feedback received by the agent for its actions.
- **Policy**: The strategy that the agent uses to make decisions.

### 3. Applications of Reinforcement Learning
- **Examples**: Game playing (like AlphaGo), robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

### Exercise
1. **Implement a Simple RL Environment**: Create a basic environment where an agent can take actions and receive rewards.
2. **Experiment**: Modify the reward system and observe how it influences the agentâ€™s behavior.
